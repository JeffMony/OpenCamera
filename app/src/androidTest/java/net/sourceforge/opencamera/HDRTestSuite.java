/** Tests for HDR algorithm - only need to run on a single device
 *  Should manually look over the images dumped onto DCIM/
 *  To use these tests, the testdata/ subfolder should be manually copied to the test device in the DCIM/testOpenCamera/
 *  folder (so you have DCIM/testOpenCamera/testdata/). We don't use assets/ as we'd end up with huge APK sizes which takes
 *  time to transfer to the device every time we run the tests.
 *  On Android 10+, scoped storage permission needs to be given to Open Camera for the DCIM/testOpenCamera/ folder.
